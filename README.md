## A personal portfolio of dashboards and other data stuff
### Each numbered item refers to the same numbered dashboard in this repo. Feel free to contact me for any kind of communications 


**1_European Social Survey 2016/2017 - Climate Change.** Dashboard made with Tableau Public starting from the European Social Survey (ESS) 2016/2017 dataset. 

**2_The impact of an international conflict. Data Analysis of the war between Russia and Ukraine.** I made this dashboard for my master's degree thesis. In the 2.1 document I present the historical background and the complete procedure, if you are interested. In case of visualization issues write me down and I will try to add you to Microsoft 365 organization for the online report visualization.
